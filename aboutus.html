                <h3>Arden</h3>
                <p>Arden is our former bassist, and current rhythm guitarist. Hailing from Nashville, she has a certain southern charm that all the ladies love. As the singer for Sundae Brunch, she’s not afraid to use her voice to tell us to practice more. She loves Joni Mitchell and the occasional spontaneous red hair dye moment. </p>

                <h3>Charlotte</h3>
                <p>Charlotte loves corn. They can’t get enough of it. We can always count on them to suggest Chilli’s as a reward for getting through practice. As Sundae Brunch’s bassist, it’s important to be grounded and dependable. You might spot Charlotte towering over the rest of the band, wearing their signature outfit of two t-shirts and circle glasses.</p>

                <h3>Hannah</h3>
                <p>Hannah is our resident piano player. With her frisbee-grabbing skills she earned from the pro-league, her fingers are extra strong to slam on the keys. She loves baseball caps and jorts, and is not afraid to speak a little spanish. We can always depend on Hannah for dead-pan quips and snacks throughout practice.</p>

                <h3>Jenna</h3>
                <p>Jenna is a programmer by day, and drummer by night. She bottles all the anger she faces through CS214 and debugging coding projects, and releases it onto the snare and the kick! She has never learned how to ride a bike. She loves peanut butter toast, her ginger friend Avery, and the feeling of solving a long winded integral.</p>
